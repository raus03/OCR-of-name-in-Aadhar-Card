How to extract text from images - 
For this purpose, I have used easyOcr 
Then I have imported other useful libraries
Then I used a pre-trained model and calculated the output which has three parts, the first part is the bounding box coordinates, the second partis the text prediction and the third part is the confidence with which it was predicted
Then I have showed the bounding box containing the name part of the aadhar card
